# React

<a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank">React.js</a> makes it painless to create interactive UIs and we see great potential to build upcoming projects with React. It follows functional programming paradigms like immutability, unidirectional data flow, and function composition that provide better code readability, fewer errors, and higher confidence in the Application life cycle which leads to saving overall costs in development and production.
