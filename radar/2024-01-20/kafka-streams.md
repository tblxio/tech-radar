# Kafka-Streams

<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/" target="_blank">Kafka Streams</a> is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in an Apache Kafka cluster. It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafkaâ€™s server-side cluster technology.

It is used in Global Services Platform / Connectivity Service Group Platform.
