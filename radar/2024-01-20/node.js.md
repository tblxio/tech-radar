# Node.js

<a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. We successfully use it since Itâ€™s a good choice for restful APIs, real-time purposes/situations where many concurrent connections are expected.
