# Redux

<a href="http://redux.js.org" target="_blank">Redux</a> helps us to maintain the state of our Frontend applications in a more predictable and clearer way by following the Flux pattern and functional programming concepts like immutability and unidirectional data flows which are highly relevant to avoid errors in large-scale stateful applications. Currently, we use Redux only in our React projects.
