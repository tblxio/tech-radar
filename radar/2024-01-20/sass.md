# Sass

<a href="http://sass-lang.com" target="_blank">Sass</a> is a preprocessor scripting language and a powerful professional-grade CSS extension that is interpreted/compiled into CSS. It was created to respond to developer needs that were not supported by native CSS, at the time. Although more modern and better alternatives are out there (mainly targeting atomic CSS), since Sass is widely used within our Business Partners code-bases, we have to support it.
