# Angular

<a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular</a> is the biggest and most-known Frontend framework used in Enterprise applications. We support it because It is been widely used by some of our Business Partners. However, we prefer using ReactÂ over Angular since it helps us achieve better stability and control in our applications.
