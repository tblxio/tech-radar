# TypeScript

<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> Is an open-source language, created by Microsoft to respond to the challenges of dealing with large applications built on complex JavaScript code-base. It provides highly productive development tools and practices by adding static type definitions and since it compiles to JavaScript, it can make use of most of its features in the browser, and in the server through Node.js or Deno.
