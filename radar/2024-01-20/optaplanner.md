# OptaPlanner

<a href="https://www.optaplanner.org/" target="_blank">OptaPlanner</a> is an AI-based constraint solver. This product is widely used by the JVM community to solve problems such as the Vehicle Routing Problem, optimization and scheduling problems. We use it internally to solve specific optimization and constraint satisfaction problems.
