# Azure API Management

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts" target="_blank">Azure API Management (APIM)</a> is a way to create consistent and modern API gateways for existing back-end services.
API Management helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. Businesses everywhere are looking to extend their operations as a digital platform, creating new channels, finding new customers and driving deeper engagement with existing ones. API Management provides the core competencies to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement, business insights, analytics, security, and protection. You can use Azure API Management to take any backend and launch a full-fledged API program based on it.
