# Jest

<a href="https://jestjs.io" target="_blank">Jest</a> is a JavaScript test runner that is designed to ensure the correctness of any JavaScript code-base and gives us integrated code coverage reports, mocking libraries, and parallel test execution.
It is the most current used tool for Frontend unit testing and is being used by us and our Business Partners in most Frontend code-bases.
